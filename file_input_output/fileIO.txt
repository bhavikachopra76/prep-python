file = open("filename.txt", "mode")

Modes:
'r' -> Read Mode
~ Opens file for reading only
~ File must exist, otherwise FileNotFoundError
~ Pointer position is at the beginning of the file

'w' -> Write Mode
~ Opens file for writing
~ If file exists → overwrites everything
~ If file does not exist → creates new file
~ Pointer position is at the beginning of the file

'a' -> Append Mode
~ Opens file for writing
~ Adds content to end of file
~ Creates file if it doesn’t exist
~ Pointer position is at the end of the file

'r+' -> Read + Write
~ Opens file for both reading and writing
~ File must exist
~ Does NOT truncate file

'w+' -> Read + Write
~ Opens file for reading and writing
~ Overwrites existing file
~ Creates new file if not exists

'a+' -> Append + Read
~ Opens file for reading and writing
~ Adds new data at end
~ Creates file if not exists

Why use 'with'?
Normally, we use f.close() at the end but if error occurs before file is closed, file stays open
But 'with' closes the file automatically even after an error

seek()
~ Moves the file cursor (pointer) to a specific position in the file.

tell()
~ Returns the current position of the file pointer.

truncate()
~ Resizes the file to a given number of bytes.
