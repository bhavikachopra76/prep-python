Class -> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods

Object -> It is an instance of class, It is a real-world entity

Constructor -> Special method that is automatically called when an object is created
Constructor = “Set things up when the object is born.”

Self -> it represents the current instance of the class. self = "This particular object"

Object Attributes -> They are defined inside __init__ These are different for each object

Class Attributes -> Shared by ALL Objects. Does not take extra objects

Methods -> They are functions inside a class

Static Methods -> Methods that belongs to a class and does not depend on self or class data
It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator

Decorator -> A decorator wraps another function to enhance its functionality dynamically
A decorator is like putting a filter on a function. The function remains the same. But now it behaves differently

Abstraction -> Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features

Encapsulation -> Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods together and restricting direct access to data
