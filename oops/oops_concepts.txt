Class -> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods

Object -> It is an instance of class, It is a real-world entity. A combination of data + behavior

Constructor -> Special method that is automatically called when an object is created
Constructor = “Set things up when the object is born.”
In Python constructor is -> __init__()

Self -> it represents the current instance of the class. self = "This particular object"

Instance Attributes -> They are defined inside __init__(). These are different for each object.

Class Attributes -> Shared by ALL Objects. This does not occupy extra space for each object, it is stored once in memory

Methods -> They are functions inside a class.
Instance Methods -> They use self, work with object data
Class Methods -> They use cls, work with class level data
Static Methods -> Methods that belongs to a class and does not depend on self or class data
It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator

Decorator -> A decorator wraps another function to enhance its functionality dynamically
A decorator is like putting a filter on a function. The function remains the same. But now it behaves differently

Encapsulation -> Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods together and restricting direct access to data.
Keeps data protected and allow access only through controlled methods.

Abstraction -> Hide internal implementation details and show only essential features.

Inheritance -> A child class acquires properties and behaviors of a parent class.

Polymorphism ->  It the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways.
