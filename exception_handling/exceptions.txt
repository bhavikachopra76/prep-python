Exceptions are errors that interrupt the normal flow of the program
-> Two types of errors:
1) Syntax Errors -> Python does not even run the program
2) Exceptions -> Code runs, but stops when something breaks

Common Types of Exceptions:
~ ZeroDivisionError -> Dividing by 0
~ IndexError -> Accessing invalid list index
~ KeyError -> Accessing missing dict key
~ TypeError -> Invalid type operation
~ Value Error -> Type is right, Value is wrong
~ FileNotFoundError -> File doesn't exist

Handle Exceptions:
Try/Except -> handles exceptions gracefully by catching runtime errors and preventing abrupt program termination
Else -> runs if no exception occurs
Finally -> runs no matter what

Custom Exceptions:
User defined exception class inherited from Python's built-in Exception class.
